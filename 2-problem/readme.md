## Support Vector Machine on Iris Flower Dataset

We are going to create a model for classifying the the type of iris based on the variables of the dataset.
In first place, we’re going to identifying the variables

### Sepal
The sepal is the part that forms the calyx of a flower, typically function as protection for the flower in bud, and often as support for the petals when in bloom.

We have two variables

* The Sepal lenght on centimeters
* The Sepal Width on centimeters

### Petal

Petals are modified leaves that surround the reproductive parts of flowers.

We have two variables

* The Petal lenght on centimeters
* The Petal Width on centimeters

### One more example

If you want to identify if an animal is a dog or a cat, it’s only natural that your input would be images of dogs and cats. Typically, this data is represented by a matrix of numerical values that correspond to each pixel in an image.
