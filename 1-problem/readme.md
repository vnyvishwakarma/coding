# Subsequent

Write a program/function to determine whether the second array is a subsequence of first one.

A subsequence of an array is a set of numbers that are not adjacent in array but that are in the same order as they appear in first array.

Example :

1. [1, 2, 4] from a subsequence of first array [1, 2, 3, 4, 8]

2. [3, 8] from a subsequence of first array [1, 2, 3, 4, 8]

Important: first and second array should not be empty [] 

Implementation Language : Python, Go and JavaScript
